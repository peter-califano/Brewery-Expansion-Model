# Brewery-Expansion-Model
---

## Project Overview
This model evaluates two strategic options for a brewery:
1. **Scenario 1:** Retain the current 1,000-barrel (bbl) production capacity, emphasizing high-margin draft sales.
2. **Scenario 2:** Expand production to 2,000 bbl per year, reducing costs through economies of scale and focusing on wholesale sales growth.

The tool incorporates:
- **P&L Calculations**: Tracks revenue, costs, and profit margins across both scenarios.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Examines how variations in demand impact the net present value (NPV) of each scenario.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Simulates demand variability to determine the probabilistic outcome of each scenario.

## Model Features
- **Profit Margin Calculation**: Analyzes revenue streams from draft and wholesale sales, incorporating cost and operating expenses.
- **NPV Analysis**: Computes the NPV of both scenarios to identify the more profitable option.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Explores the interaction of draft and wholesale demand on profitability.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Runs 1,000 iterations to calculate the average NPV and the likelihood of each scenario's success.

## How to Use the Model
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Adjust demand ranges for draft and wholesale sales.
   - Update operating costs, production costs, and pricing assumptions.
2. **Run Scenarios**:
   - Use the "What-If Analysis" in Excel to perform sensitivity analysis.
   - Execute the Monte Carlo simulation to assess probabilistic outcomes.
3. **Interpret Results**:
   - Compare NPVs, sensitivity tables, and Monte Carlo outputs to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Insights
- **Scenario 2** is more likely to yield higher profits, with a 60% probability of exceeding Scenario 1's NPV.
- Sensitivity analysis identifies critical demand thresholds for choosing the optimal strategy.
- Expansion reduces per-barrel costs and positions the brewery for sustained growth, albeit with higher risk.
